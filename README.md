# What is Docker?

    Docker makes development efficient and predictable

    Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

    -- The Docker team

Docker allows us 
* to deploy applications inside "containers" (~very lightweight virtual machines)
* instead of just shipping an application, we can ship an application and the environment it's meant to run in
